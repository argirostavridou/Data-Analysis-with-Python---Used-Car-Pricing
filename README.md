This program is written in Python and is designed to analyze and process a dataset containing information about used cars. Using this program, the following tasks are performed:

Data Cleaning: Correcting or removing inaccurate data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through statistical methods and visualizations.
Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs for better data comprehension.
Model Development: Building models to predict prices or other features of the cars.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the accuracy and performance of the models.

The program utilizes Python libraries such as pandas and numpy for data processing, as well as other specialized libraries for model development and evaluation.

This project is based on exercises from the Labs in the "Data Analysis with Python" course that I have completed on Coursera online learning platform and is part of the "IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate" by Coursera.
